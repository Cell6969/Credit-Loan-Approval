This project was inspired by a friend of mine who wrote an essay on the theme "Technological Innovation in the Field of Finance." The aim of this project is to create a system that can classify whether a person's credit application is acceptable or not.

The data i use from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication 

The data has 13 column with one dependent variable 'Loan_Status'. In a notebook, I perform several steps such as EDA, data cleaning, data pre-processing, model training and validation. The model i use in this project is Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
